The Fly on Doritos
His fingers were aching terribly from all those online job applications he has been filling out non-stop for the past 3 hours. Even though it was the year 2077, jobs were scarce. Vincent's dull eyes popped open when he saw a job interview invitation from ([[Doritos]], [[Dominoes|Doritos]], [[B&M|Doritos]]) on his email.
Doritos
He clicked it open and accepted it instantly as if it was a free one million pounds coupon. His interview is in a few months and he really needed this job. Vincent started his research on the interviewers he will be meeting, [[he checked their photos and some videos]] to speculate how they can be impressed.
[[don't check]]

Then he started doing some research on the building where the interview is
and put the location of the interview down to 2 places the [[HR Building]]
and the[[Main Building]]

He turned up to the interview, severeal unprepared. He was put on the spot and had to think on his feet. He didn't get the job.

HR Building
He even checked what kind of chairs were there in the photos he found so that he would avoid making any annoying noises while pulling the chair to sit in front of the interviewers. Vincent's brain more or less changed into a mini supercomputer doing all sort of calculations to simulate his interview scenario with the pieces of information he had. In between all of these thoughts, his friend's name randomly crossed his mind.

His friend, Jules, is an expert programmer working at Google. He has attended so many interviews and managed to do great in all of them, Vincent never understood how he did it. There must be a secret to it, he could either [[ask him]] or [[don't ask him]].

Whenever Vincent asks Jules how he does it Jules goes on to explain how he simulates his interview scenario on his home supercomputer but Vincent never understood what the hell was he on about. Vincent thought Jules might be able to [[give him some advice]] on how to handle this interview. So Vincent contacts Jules using his Neural Galaxy S77 implanted in his brain and waits for his hologram to show up on his smartwatch.

“Oh, hi Vincent, you seem a lot happier than the last time we met” Jules said. “Oh Jules, I can’t believe you back! You changed my situation for the better and I can’t thank you enough” Vincent yells. Jules then shares the new idea with Vincent and convinces him that simulation is the one that will do his interview wonders! So Jules says: “I will create a simulation of your interview to get the perfect result and outcome of the job interview, are you ready to do this with me?”
[[“Of course, please do it for me I’m so thrilled about it mate, and by the way come down my house today eve and we’ll have a cup of coffee planning it what do you reckon?”]]

 "You are a good friend, Jules. Thank you! " says Vincent with hope in his eyes thinking about how successful the interview will be.
There was no denying in the fact that Jules is the smartest man Vincent knows. For an accurate simulation, they need to do some research about the environment, about the interviewers and gather all the crucial information they can get their hands on.
[["Every detail is important no matter how insignificant it may appear to us. Even anticipating the weather state is vital for the success of our simulation. Says Jules with a serious face trying to make Vincent understand." ]]
[["You don't need to focus on every detail just focus on important events in simulation. Says Jules with a serious face trying to make Vincent understand."]]

As days pass by and the big interview is getting closer, Vincent gets more and more nervous. "What if I will mess up? What if I will forget when is the right moment to sit on my chair? " he asks himself panicked.
Vincent calls his friend again to tell him about his worries.
[[Jules laughs. "Calm down Vincent! Our simulations have the purpose to guide you. Take it easy! Breathe! Everything will turn out just fine. Sometimes what is important is to trust yourself. Computers are smart, but they can not do that. " ]]

He knew what the interviewers were like. But Vincent was focused on getting the job. He wanted it to be done. He was wearing:

Vincent was an hour early for the interview, so he opted to sit somewhere and take a sip of coffee so as not to fall asleep during the interview. He waits in the queue to order his favourite succulent coffee from Costa. While waiting in the queue he noticed in a post the new caramel cappuccino at the same price as a normal cappuccino. What did he ordered?:
[[normal cappuccino]]

Because of Vincent's dress up, he was seen as unprofessional and consequently didn't get this job

He sits outside the building sipping that new aroma of caramel mixed with cappuccino until a notification audio comes on his neural galaxy s77 which stops him drinking. The neural implant asks Vincent if he wants to accept the audio notifications from Jules

the coffee didn't taste right, something about it was off. He started walking around and his head felt sore. As time progressed he felt more and more disorientated until he lost consciousness. He didn't make it for the interview.

he agrees
"Hi Vincent, I know you're nervous but don't worry, just remember how
things went during the simulation, there you will. I look forward to hearing from you after the interview, bye". Vincent does not notice the time he has spent on the Costa, he hurries up without finishing his caramel coffee. He hurried to the basket and threw the cup which hit the edge of the basket as the coffee spills to the ground. A drop hit Vincent's blazer as he carelessly ran towards the building's entrance.

As he got closer to the building he was feeling content and he was ready to get the job. Vincent enters the building carefully and goes to the reception where a young woman was busy arranging files through a virtual touchpad computer. He waits until the woman finishes her work and notices him. “ Hello, how may I help you?” she said to Vincent. Vincent replied: [[“Hi, I have an interview at 9.00, I’m Vincent Carrera”]]
[["Hello, I've been waiting for you to finish your work for a few minutes now]]
“Hi, I have an interview at 9.00, I’m Vincent Carrera”
“Oh, you should go to floor 13 room 13. Good luck !” The floor and room number made Vincent feel a little uneasy but he got over it quickly. He soon arrives at the door and an assistant invites him in.
[[He enters in an all-white room where a 2-meter long table in the centre with 4 people seated on one side awaited him. Dressed in black like judges

He wasn't too happy about this but at least he had a job. Thoughrout his working life, all he could think about was wether that stain on his suit made all the difference.
Position for a senior software developer
This was his dream, he couldn't have been happier. He lived out the rest of his days a very rich and happy man.

This was not the job he intended to get but he was satisfied with it. He lived out the rest of his life confortably with enough money to live nicely.
